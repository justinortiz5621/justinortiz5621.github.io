<strong>Dear visitor, <br>
	Congratulations! You have found the Garthim archive. This website is the last remaining home of a program whose sole purpose is to situate art in unique and fortuitous ways. <br>
	If you have found this site it means you were meant to. Do not think better of it, fate led you here. - J</strong><br>

	2020_Garthim is thrilled to present Dewdrop Toadstool Hopscotch, the first solo exhibition from Isabelle Adams at Matthiessen State
Park in central Illinois, USA. The park is centered on a stream that has eaten partway through layers of rock leaving a cavernous
ravine made of amorphous stone formations. Minerals in the local groundwater create glistening plays of color.
We hope you enjoy the exhibition.<br><br>
	<i>Swinging my limbs from two and froth<br>
Dripping, them, in the blistering broth<br>
Careful not wake the slumbering fly<br>
Which hovers patiently shore-wise<br>
Wait, just wait, until they see<br>
What precious gifts I leave with thee<br>
Not mouse<br>
Nor mudpie<br>
Nor groveling snots<br>
Can match my game of Dewdrop Hopscotch<br></i>

	2020_Garthim is thrilled to present its first installment of Kaleidoscope with Gilgal, Thomas Child Jr.'s backyard sculpture garden in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. Child worked obsessively on Gilgal until his death in 1963, accepting few visitors during the period of its making. He went to great lengths to realize the works within. Silica quartzite boulders were transplanted from the Utah desert into the garden and heat-sculpted with oxyacetylene torches. Among his sculptures is a sphinx with the face of Joseph Smith. The monumental, devotional golems stand as cryptic meditations on his purpose as an object maker through the lens of his Mormonism. History hasn't yet found a place for Child, whose religious art is private and obscure. We hope you enjoy a look into Gilgal.<br>

	<br>2021_Garthim is happy to present Hushed Inheritance, Tatiana Sky's first solo exhibition at Vasquez Rocks Natural Area in Southern California, USA. The Vasquez Rocks are a 25 million year old phenomenon of desert geology where sedimentary rock is tiled into an alien landscape. Caves and sandstone navels have been eroded from the cliffs by years of earthquakes, rain and wind. Industrious creatures make their dens inside alcoves of sun-warmed rock. Desert lichen is splattered under bronze castings, their ash patinas spotlighted by the energy of the Mojave sun. 
We hope you enjoy the exhibition. <br><br>

	2021_Garthim presents Cube 6, a group exhibition of works on paper from six artists living in the United States taking place in Los Angeles, California. Garthim fabricated "Cube 6," a modular exhibition cube, for the purpose of assimilating these artworks into the location where they were installed. Like any legitimate attempt at camouflage, this is sometimes effective and sometimes much less than that. The wood base of "Cube 6" was fabricated in part using images of Japanese designer Naho Matsuno's stool and is named after her original design. Images of the original, "Cube 3," can be found <a href="https://www.naho-matsuno.com/cube3-1">here</a>.We hope you enjoy the exhibition.<br>

	2021_Garthim is thrilled to present Gone Broody, a solo exhibition of new work by Chris Peckham and the artist's first exhibition with Garthim. The nomad builds a fort and searches for peace. Within a dwelling constructed from wooden limbs is a reprieve from all momentum. For this time, luminous rectangles inhabit the transient dweller as the structure forks upward in repose. We hope you enjoy the exhibition.<br>

	2021_Garthim's contribution to 2121 Time Capsule, a group show at Goodbuy Gallery, Bucharest curated by Christian Roncea, is this letter by Isabelle Adams. Written to a reader in the distant future, the letter has been archived in a time capsule alongside digital documentation of "Dewdrop Toadstool Hopscotch," the artist's 2020 solo exhibition with Garthim. We hope you enjoy the text as much as we do.<br>

	2021_Garthim is proud to present Ditch Number 3, a solo exhibition of new paintings by Maryland based artist Jacob Mattingly. Pictures which suggest an amoebic universe are nestled in the crotch of a 7,000 foot peak; a growth on the face of a giant alight with foreign, inorganic pigments. We hope you enjoy the exhibition.<br>

	2022_Garthim chose to share a module of Ken Isaacs' 1970s "living structures" for this year's Baitball Project Fair hosted at Palazzo San Giuseppe, Bari, Italy. We've been using an adaptation of the living structure to hang artworks in our off-site exhibitions. So, when tasked to set an installation indoors we built a quarter scale version as a sculptural object/diagram. As we have taken from Ken Isaacs, we hope that others might be inspired to take his idea and make it into something new. We hope to serve some digestive function in the Baitball feast, our idea being metabolized by the viewer and transformed into a second or third novel thing as Isaacs intended when he published How to Build Your Own Living Structures. How to Build Your Own Living Structures by Ken Isaacs is available to read <a href="http://www.publiccollectors.org/LivingStructuresk_isaacs-1.pdf">here</a>.<br>

	2022_An untitled Garthim exhibition including works by Faysal Altunbozar and Allen Brewer. The sculptures were installed at the Olsen Ruins in Yucca Valley, once the site of an infamous murder which took place during gold rush California. The artworks play off of the site's energy at dusk, when the desert is apt to turn ito a dark, uncertain expanse. We hope you enjoy the exhibition. <br>
